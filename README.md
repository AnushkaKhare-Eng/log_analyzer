Security Log Analyzer
#Purpose:
Leveraging AI to enhance security log parsing such that it can detect IoC ( indicators of compromise) and come to a valid conclusion about the type of cyber attack or techniques used by adversaries. 
I want to grow my threat research, vulnerbaility analysis and malware analysis skills while incorporating AI. 

#Target: 
Once developed this tool should be usable by anyone who has security log information and wants to detect compromises. The tool will not guarantee data protection or porvacy in the initial stages. 

#Stages of the project: 
Identification of Metrics of Interest
Finding publicly available data  
Deciding the best model to use
